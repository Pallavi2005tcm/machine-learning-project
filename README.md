# Email Spam Classifier Using Naive Bayes

## Overview
This project implements an **Email Spam Classifier** using the **Naive Bayes algorithm**. The classifier can predict whether an email is **spam** or **not spam** (ham) based on its content.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate text classification, feature extraction, and basic machine learning concepts in Python.

---

## Features
- Preprocessing of email text (removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.)
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF
- Classification using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- Evaluation of model accuracy, precision, and recall
- Works on real-world email datasets

---

## Dataset
The project uses a labeled email dataset. Example datasets you can use:
- [SpamAssassin Public Corpus](http://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/)
- [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) (optional for testing)
